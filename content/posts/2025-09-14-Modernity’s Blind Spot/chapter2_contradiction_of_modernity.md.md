# Chapter II. Diagnosing the Disease: The Contradiction at the Heart of Modernity

Modernity presents itself as a project of liberation—an emancipation from the oppressive structures, superstitions, and unquestioned traditions of the past. It promises not merely freedom for the privileged few, but universal empowerment. This vision is grounded in the celebration of individuality and the elevation of self-interest as a legitimate—and even noble—expression of personal freedom.

But a paradox is unfolding before our eyes: freedom for some increasingly entails domination over others. If each person is encouraged to pursue their self-interest above all else, it becomes inevitable that the strong will seek to entrench their position by constraining the freedom of the weak. The system that promises liberation ends up institutionalizing new forms of exploitation. In such a world, “freedom” no longer means mutual flourishing—it means the freedom to outcompete, outspend, and overpower.

There are many tangible manifestations of this contradiction. Consider the economic realm, where the free market is upheld as the archetype of rational self-interest in action. Here, autonomous agents are expected to compete in pursuit of personal gain, while the state intervenes only minimally—to enforce contracts, maintain order, and prevent fraud. But within this logic lies the seed of its own undoing. It is in the self-interest of many market participants to eliminate competition, not preserve it. The drive to maximize market share leads inevitably to monopolies, and monopolies distort the very freedoms the market was meant to secure.

This economic dynamic is not a fluke. It reflects a deeper structural flaw within modernity: a system built on self-interest will inevitably reward behaviors that concentrate power, whether in commerce, technology, or politics. And each domain reveals its own version of the same underlying contradiction.

Consider, for example, the legal and political domain. A pivotal moment came with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Buckley v. Valeo (1976). In this case, the plaintiffs challenged federal limits on campaign contributions and independent political expenditures, arguing that such restrictions infringed on their First Amendment right to free speech—particularly their ability to use personal wealth to support preferred candidates and causes. The Court struck a compromise: while it upheld limits on direct contributions (to prevent corruption), it ruled that independent expenditures—money spent to influence elections without coordinating with campaigns—could not be restricted.

The ruling effectively equated political spending with free expression. In theory, this protected individual liberty; in practice, it skewed democratic participation heavily in favor of the wealthy. Over time, the result has been a political system increasingly dominated by moneyed interests, where access, influence, and visibility are functions of financial capacity. This is not merely a regulatory failure—it is the logical consequence of treating self-interested freedom as the highest political value. What begins as a defense of liberty ends in the quiet subversion of collective governance. A democracy that allows power to be purchased ceases to function as a democracy.

The contradiction is clear: freedom, pursued as an absolute and individualistic ideal, undermines the very conditions that make shared freedom possible. Modernity promises equality and empowerment, but in elevating self-interest above solidarity, it builds structures that reward domination and disempowerment. In short; self-interest leads to domination, not liberation.

Worse still, the pursuit of self-interest is not only morally questionable—it is ultimately self-defeating. The systems that enable wealth creation, technological innovation, and political stability all depend on the health of the societies and ecologies in which they operate. Yet in the drive to extract more value—by cutting labor costs, externalizing environmental harm, or dismantling public services—those foundational conditions are the first to be eroded. The irony is stark: a market obsessed with efficiency will, if left unchecked, destroy the very consumers, workers, and environments it depends on. We are right to ask: who will the market serve if its ultimate goal is to eliminate labor entirely? What happens when no one can afford the goods efficiently produced by a system that has rendered them economically irrelevant?

Ultimately, the foundational error of modernity may be its impoverished conception of the self—an atomized individual pursuing private gain, detached from the webs of relationship that make life meaningful and sustainable. What this framework fails to recognize is that our interests are not discrete but entangled. No one truly flourishes in a society where others are degraded. No market thrives for long in a crumbling social order. No technology uplifts humanity if it hollows out our shared world. The paradox at the heart of modernity—the pursuit of freedom that leads to domination, the quest for rational systems that generate irrational outcomes—can only be resolved by transcending the narrow view of self-interest that underpins it. This is not an abandonment of reason, but its maturation: a deeper rationality that sees interdependence, empathy, and reciprocity not as constraints, but as the real logic of human flourishing.
