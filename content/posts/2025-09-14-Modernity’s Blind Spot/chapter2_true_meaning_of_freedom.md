# The True Meaning of Freedom 

We find ourselves living in unsettling times. The United States has long prided itself as “the land of the free and the home of the brave.” Yet today, that freedom feels increasingly fragile. Across the nation, people march in defense of democracy, anxious that the principles once thought unshakable are now at risk of erosion. The very country that helped define modern liberty finds itself struggling to preserve it.

At the heart of this paradox lies a profound misunderstanding of freedom itself. For many, freedom has come to mean simply doing whatever one wishes—the absence of restraint, especially from government or social norms. But this understanding is shallow. Freedom cannot mean the mere ability to act without consequence, for such freedom often empowers the strong at the expense of the weak. The absence of restraint, far from guaranteeing equality, can magnify inequality: the wealthy, the well-connected, and the powerful already live with fewer restraints than others.

To gain clearer insight, we must recognize that freedom is not a bedrock value; justice is. Freedom, taken in isolation, can justify almost anything—from exploitation to anarchy. It becomes virtuous only when it serves the cause of justice. This is why no society ever grants absolute freedom: we are not free to harm, deceive, or steal, because such acts violate the just order that makes freedom possible in the first place.

This idea is often phrased in liberal terms: you are free to do whatever you wish, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. Yet a reformulation in terms of justice reaches deeper. “Rights” are legal abstractions; “justice” is lived and felt. People instinctively recognize when something is unfair, even before they can articulate why. Justice appeals to our moral intuition—our sense of balance, reciprocity, and shared dignity. Rights may or may not be legally recognized, but justice transcends legality. The systematic oppression of Black, Brown, and Indigenous peoples across centuries is proof enough: the law may have sanctioned it, but justice never did. Justice is not granted by governments—it is inscribed in the human conscience.

With this understanding, it becomes clear that freedom is a virtue precisely because it is just to allow people to live authentic lives—to act in accordance with conscience, reason, and their deepest values. Such freedom requires more than the absence of chains; it demands virtue and self-knowledge. Without understanding our own motivations and needs, our choices are easily manipulated by advertising, ideology, or fear. Freedom thus depends on education, reflection, and a public culture that prizes truth over convenience.

If today we are finding that our country is slipping into tyranny it is because the vast multitude of people in the United States have misunderstood the nature of freedom and how to preserve it. It is instructive to turn to the founding fathers of this country to gain clearer insight. 

## Founding fathers: Liberty without virtue is no liberty at all 

For the American Founding Fathers, who were steeped in both Enlightenment and classical philosophy, liberty unmoored from virtue becomes self-destructive. As **John Adams** put it bluntly, liberty requires self-restraint, or it devours itself. In his thought, self-government requires restraint by the powerful lest it devolve into tyranny. He wrote: 

> “The only foundation of a free Constitution is pure Virtue, and if this cannot be inspired into our People in a greater Measure than they have it now, They may change their Rulers and the forms of Government, but they will not obtain a lasting Liberty.”
>
> — John Adams, *Letter to Zabdiel Adams (1776)*

And it was not just rulers that needed moderation through virtue, it was especially the people themselves. **James Madison** wrote: 

>  To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea.
>
> — James Madison, [Virginia Ratifying Convention](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s36.html) (1788)

The U.S. Constitution had been drafted the previous year (1787), and each state was holding conventions to decide whether to ratify it. Virginia’s convention was one of the most contentious, with fierce opposition from Anti-Federalists like Patrick Henry and George Mason, who feared that a stronger federal government would endanger liberty.

Madison, as one of the Constitution’s chief architects and a leading Federalist, was defending the new framework of government. His argument was that no mere institutional design — however carefully constructed — could guarantee liberty unless the people themselves possessed virtue. He said, in essence that you can craft the best possible constitution, with all the checks and balances in the world, but if citizens lack moral character, discipline, and a sense of justice, even the most perfect form of government will collapse into corruption or tyranny.

## What is virtue? 

What, then, were the civic virtues the Founding Fathers were referring to? First and foremost, they emphasized self-restraint—especially among those with power. Just because one can do something does not mean one should. Liberty does not equal license, and might does not equal right. Freedom, in their view, required the moral discipline to restrain selfish impulses and act in service of the common good.

Equally vital was the duty to stand up for what is just and to protect the weak from the powerful. A free people must not only refrain from wrongdoing but also actively defend what is right. Perhaps it is no coincidence that modern fairy tales of superheroes were born in America: figures who use their power not for domination, but for protection. These ideals—self-restraint, justice, and the defense of the vulnerable—are, in truth, more American than apple pie.

Early America understood freedom as inseparable from responsibility. Care for the poor was not a right but a duty — one grounded in moral conscience rather than state mandate. Citizens felt answerable not only to their neighbors but to their own sense of virtue. The French observer **Alexis de Tocqueville**, writing in the 1830s, was struck by this civic spirit. He marveled that:

> “Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds, constantly unite. … They make great and real sacrifices to the public welfare.”
> — Democracy in America, 1835

For Tocqueville, the strength of American democracy lay not in its laws but in its habits of the heart — the moral and religious sensibilities that moved citizens to act for the common good. These voluntary associations, born of conscience rather than compulsion, filled the space between individual and state.

Yet this virtue-based safety net also excluded many; it depended on belonging. Those deemed outside the moral community — the enslaved, Indigenous peoples, immigrants — were left unprotected. In time, however, as society grew wealthier and more complex modernity’s expansion of rights would universalize compassion — extending it far beyond one’s town or creed — but at the cost of severing it from virtue. What was once a moral duty of citizens became an administrative function of the state. The heart yielded to bureaucracy.

## The Inner dimension of Freedom 

If virtue is the foundation of freedom, it is because being enslaved to one’s passions is no freedom at all. A person ruled by greed, anger, or vanity may appear free in the political sense, but inwardly they are captive to impulse. Consider addiction: no law restrains the addict, yet no one would call them free. The bottle, the screen, or the craving commands them more absolutely than any tyrant could. The same logic applies, in subtler ways, to all forms of ungoverned desire. True liberty is not the license to do as one pleases, but the strength to master what pleases us. It begins within — in the discipline of self-knowledge and the quiet conquest of one’s own lower impulses.

This insight is not unique to the Enlightenment or the American tradition. It echoes across spiritual and philosophical lineages:

* Christianity: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Freedom here is inseparable from truth — and truth requires discipline, humility, and integrity.
* Ancient Greece: The Delphic injunction “Know thyself” was not a slogan of self-expression, but of self-understanding — the wisdom that precedes freedom.
* Islamic tradition: **Imam Ali** taught, “The strongest man is he who conquers himself,” and “Your greatest enemy is your own soul which lies between your two sides.” For him, as for the Stoics or early Christians, the struggle for freedom was above all a struggle against inner tyranny.

Across these traditions, freedom and virtue are two faces of the same coin: both aim to align the human being with what is true, good, and just. Without that inner alignment, outer liberty decays into license.
