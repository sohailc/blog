What empirical evidence shows that modernity has failed to meet deeper human needs? One clear symptom is the erosion of trust—not just in political institutions, but in the very fabric of everyday life. We are increasingly skeptical of the systems that govern us, and alienated from the people who live among us. But signs of this disconnection are visible everywhere—from urban design and consumer culture to the synthetic, algorithmic realities now offered to soothe our growing loneliness.

## III.1 Urban Uncertainty: When Efficiency Undermines Belonging

Modern urban planning in North America offers a vivid case study of how modernity, in its quest for rational order and efficiency, has often sidelined deeper human needs for connection, beauty, and meaning.

Beginning in the mid-20th century, city planners embraced a vision of progress defined by speed and mobility. The automobile became the organizing principle of the built environment, reshaping urban life around sprawling suburbs, wide highways, and rigid zoning laws that separated residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. These measures were celebrated at the time as triumphs of scientific, modern planning—delivering order, predictability, and the promise of unfettered movement.

Yet the results were far from utopian. The landscapes that emerged were optimized for throughput rather than presence: efficient in moving vehicles, perhaps, but often sterile, and isolating.

From a purely economic perspective, this suburban model is also difficult to justify. Research consistently shows that low-density development produces far less tax revenue per acre than compact, mixed-use urban cores—while demanding much more infrastructure to sustain. Smart Growth America’s Building Better Budgets report, for example, found that smart-growth or infill development generates ten times more tax revenue per acre and costs 38% less in infrastructure than conventional sprawl. Similarly, data from Florida compiled by Urban3 demonstrate that dense, walkable development yields vastly higher fiscal returns per acre than sprawling suburbs, which often cannot generate enough revenue to maintain their own infrastructure over the long run.

But the shortcomings are not merely fiscal. Suburban sprawl’s built forms—strip malls, big-box stores, and the notorious “stroads” (awkward hybrids of streets and roads)—erode local identity. A photo of one strip mall could be taken in Florida, Ohio, or British Columbia; its generic façades reveal nothing about place. Stroads, meanwhile, are neither safe for pedestrians nor efficient for vehicles, creating environments that are both fragmented and alienating

This physical design also reshapes social life. Walkability—a cornerstone of vibrant, civic-minded communities—has been sacrificed in favor of car dependency. In many suburbs, even the shortest errand requires a vehicle. Residents are siloed from one another, and spontaneous encounters—once the lifeblood of public space—become rare. The pedestrian, emblematic of community life, has been replaced by the commuter, moving quickly from one private enclosure to another.

Small wonder, then, that so many North Americans pay a premium to vacation in the kinds of places they no longer live: walkable European towns, historic city centers, or even the carefully engineered simulation of Disneyland. These destinations offer more than charm; they provide a coherent sense of place. Streets and squares are designed at a human scale, privileging presence over speed, identity over anonymity.

The “suburban dream” promised freedom and convenience, but it has revealed a deeper spiritual malaise. In designing for mobility, we designed against community. In optimizing for convenience, we neglected what it means to dwell—to belong, to share space, to encounter others as more than obstacles to efficiency.

Modernity’s failure here is not one of intelligence or ambition. It is a failure of abstraction: in treating human beings as units of calculation rather than as embodied, interdependent, meaning-seeking individuals. What remains is a geography of estrangement—rationally planned, yet spiritually impoverished.

## III.2 Manufactured Realities: The Rise of Artificial Worlds

But the most striking sign of our disconnection may lie not in physical space or social institutions, but in the realm of perception itself. If earlier expressions of modernity fragmented our built environments and hollowed out communal life, today’s digital and algorithmic systems threaten to sever us from reality altogether.

Powerful financial and technological interests are no longer merely selling products—they are designing immersive realities. Through artificial intelligence and extended reality (XR) platforms, they are increasingly able to shape not only what people consume, but what they see, hear, and believe. These efforts are not just marketing campaigns; they are attempts to construct entire perceptual worlds—highly curated environments that define what counts as real, desirable, or even possible.

The most explicit manifestation of this ambition was Meta’s launch of the metaverse—a virtual environment designed to be always-on, immersive, and socially central. Meta’s rebranding from Facebook to reflect this vision underscores the scale of its intent: to be not just a social network, but the infrastructure of human interaction itself. The metaverse, like other forms of synthetic media, represents a kind of soft control—offering choice and exploration, but always within a framework engineered by corporate interests, optimized for engagement, monetization, and behavioral nudging.

AI plays a central role in this project. Generative models are now capable of tailoring content, generating companions, filtering information, and shaping narratives in ways that feel personal, even intimate. But this personalization is not neutral. It is steered by commercial logic and increasingly by algorithmic inference: what you are shown is not what is true or meaningful, but what will keep you watching, scrolling, buying, or believing.

This is not science fiction. It’s a continuation of the long project of reducing people to consumers—now accelerated by technologies that can simulate reality itself. And the result is not empowerment, but dependency: users immersed in artificial environments, subtly shaped by invisible incentives, while the architects of those systems grow ever more powerful.

The disconnection is nearly complete: from place, from community, from shared truth, and finally from our own perceptions. Modernity once promised liberation and self-realization—but it now risks producing the opposite: a society of atomized individuals, floating through commodified, curated, and increasingly synthetic realities, unsure of what is real, or even who they are.

## III.3 A Society Without Anchors
This alienation is not limited to the physical or economic domains. We increasingly mistrust not just institutions, but one another. Demographic change, ideological polarization, and algorithmically amplified fear have made neighbors feel like strangers. As shared reference points disappear, cultural coherence unravels.

Institutions that once mediated this social trust have eroded. Labor unions, once vital organs of working-class solidarity and identity, have been weakened or dismantled. They offered not just economic leverage but belonging—a reason to see oneself as part of something larger. Religious institutions, too—churches, synagogues, mosques—have faded from centrality. These once provided not only moral orientation but communal rootedness. Their decline has left a vacuum that digital spaces have failed to fill.

The result is a population increasingly unmoored from meaning-making structures. Online forums and platforms often deepen the fragmentation, drawing people into ideological silos, conspiratorial subcultures, or performative identities that offer the appearance of connection without its substance.

More than a century ago, **Émile Durkheim** diagnosed this condition as anomie—a breakdown of social norms that leaves individuals unanchored and adrift. For Durkheim, anomie was not mere malaise; it was a structural byproduct of modernization, a mismatch between the pace of societal change and the slower evolution of culture and values.

We are living in a second wave of anomie—one mediated by digital technologies, but rooted in the same failures of cohesion and meaning. The symptoms are visible: rising suicide rates, an opioid crisis, deepening loneliness, and the radicalization of isolated individuals through extremist communities online.

Even the outwardly successful are not exempt. Careerism often replaces connection. Curated media personas mask insecurity and isolation. Networks grow, but intimacy shrinks. Beneath the surface of “achievement” lies a void.

## III.4 The Crisis Beneath the Crisis
Our world is fraying at the seams. Conspiracy theories thrive. Populists flourish. Democratic institutions falter. Environmental collapse looms. And international instability has brought us to the brink of nuclear disaster more than once in recent memory.

The promises of modernity—freedom, rational order, authenticity—now seem increasingly out of reach. What happened?

As argued earlier, part of the answer lies in modernity’s impoverished conception of the self: as an autonomous, self-interested actor. In theory, enlightened self-interest should guide us toward mutual flourishing but evidently this has not happened. The reason for this is that it's not enough to know that we are interconnected, we must feel the same for people to act upon this impulse. 

Modernity’s great blind spot is its inability to account for the full range of human experience. For all its rational accomplishments, it lacks a framework for understanding subjective life: emotional resonance, spiritual depth, moral longing. These dimensions are not incidental—they are central. And without them, we cannot build systems that humans actually want to inhabit.

The question before us now is how this blind spot toward subjective experience came to be—and, more crucially, how modernity might evolve to repair it. If we fail to adapt, we risk not merely stagnation but regression: a return to pre-modern patterns of thought and governance. And in a world armed with nuclear weapons and shaped by global interdependence, such regression could prove catastrophic.
