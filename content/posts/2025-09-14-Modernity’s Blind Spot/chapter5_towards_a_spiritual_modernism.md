What do I mean by spirituality? For many, the term evokes irrationality or superstition—but that is not how I use it. For me, spirituality means recognizing that our interconnected world is alive with meaning. Yes, meaning is inherently subjective, but that does not make it trivial or arbitrary. To be spiritual, in this sense, is to acknowledge that our actions ripple outward in ways we may never fully trace—that just because we cannot map every causal chain does not mean those connections are unreal. And with that awareness comes ethical responsibility. 

We must reformulate modernity in spiritually grounded ways. This does not mean a return to religious dogma, but rather the cultivation of a cultural and institutional framework in which subjective experience can be taken seriously—reasoned with, not dismissed. 

Individual autonomy, modernity’s gift to mankind, is to be respected. However, people need tools to make sense of their inner lives, and public spaces must be open to discourse about meaning, purpose, and moral responsibility. This calls for institutions capable of offering ethical guidance—not only traditional religious bodies, but also educational systems, media platforms, and civic organizations. Ideally, these forces would work in interplay, fostering a pluralistic moral ecosystem that supports both individual reflection and collective wisdom.

## V.1 Practical spirituality in action

Traditional religious institutions can—and should—play a key role in fostering practical spirituality. But to do so meaningfully, their outlook must align with the values of individual autonomy and personal dignity. Rather than adopting a posture of judgment or doctrinal rigidity, they must become hosts of moral hospitality—welcoming all who seek meaning, grounding, and communal belonging in an age marked by disorientation and moral drift.

Encouragingly, many religious bodies already recognize the need for this shift. Across diverse traditions, vibrant movements are working to reconcile spiritual depth with modern values like autonomy, pluralism, and ethical reasoning. Catholic and mainline Protestant denominations have increasingly embraced inclusive ethics and social justice; progressive Islamic thinkers are renewing the ethical core of tradition in light of contemporary pluralism; and various strands of Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism continue to cultivate inner awareness alongside communal responsibility.

Yet the task cannot fall to religious institutions alone. Media platforms, educational systems, and civic organizations must also take part in creating spaces where moral reflection and shared meaning are possible—spaces where subjectivity is not dismissed, but reasoned with and respected.

Media organizations today occupy a powerful space in shaping public perception, yet they often struggle to balance their roles as informers, educators, and entertainers. Today’s media ecosystem is not limited to traditional news outlets or algorithm-driven social media platforms. It includes a rapidly growing field of digital-first commentary shows, podcasts, and streaming news—many of which rival or surpass mainstream outlets in audience size and cultural influence. Across platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Substack, figures such as The Young Turks, Secular Talk, The Majority Report, and Zeteo on the left, and Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and others on the right, shape how millions of people interpret current events, morality, and public life.

While this shift has broadened access to diverse viewpoints, it has also intensified the incentives for emotional engagement over factual clarity. The business model rewards content that provokes, polarizes, or flatters rather than informs. This creates a feedback loop where attention is prioritized over accuracy, and entertainment often eclipses thoughtful analysis.

To counteract this, media organizations—both old and new—must recommit to a deeper ethical responsibility. This doesn't mean pretending to be "neutral," which can obscure underlying assumptions or falsely equate all perspectives. Instead, it means striving for objectivity: a principled commitment to truth-seeking, transparency, and intellectual integrity, while being honest about one’s editorial framework or ideological leaning. In doing so, media can help restore a culture of serious public reasoning—one that informs rather than manipulates, and that supports rather than erodes the public's moral and civic literacy.

Education must aspire to more than preparing individuals for the marketplace. While skills training and economic mobility are important, they are not sufficient to sustain a healthy, flourishing society. A purely utilitarian view of education—one focused solely on employability, productivity, and market value—neglects the deeper human need for meaning, ethical discernment, and civic responsibility.

Instead, we must recover the idea of education as the cultivation of character. This means fostering intellectual humility, emotional intelligence, moral reasoning, and a sense of responsibility toward others and the world. It involves asking not just What can I do with my knowledge?, but What kind of person am I becoming? and What obligations do I have to the communities I’m part of?

Subjects like literature, philosophy, history, religious studies, and the arts are not luxuries—they are essential arenas where young people learn to wrestle with complexity, ambiguity, and moral questions. An education system that values these domains is one that sees students not as future employees, but as whole human beings capable of reflection, compassion, and ethical leadership.

In this way, schools and universities—alongside families, religious communities, and media—can become incubators of a richer, more grounded form of modernity: one that prizes not just knowledge, but wisdom.

Finally, civil society organizations—driven by private initiative in service of the public good—must not be overlooked. This broad realm includes interfaith groups, charities, professional associations, labor unions, and advocacy organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). These institutions play a vital role in sustaining democratic culture, fostering social trust, and articulating shared values in a pluralistic society.

## V.2 Political reformation 

In this paper, I have argued for a spiritually grounded modernity and contrasted it with the mechanistic worldview that dominates much of our present. The mechanistic worldview did not rise to prominence simply because it was more “true” or “rational.” It prevailed because it served as a powerful ideological instrument for consolidating control. Once nature—and by extension, society—was conceived as a machine, human beings could be managed, optimized, and disciplined like any other resource. This conception served the interests of political and financial elites, who increasingly governed through bureaucracy, surveillance, and market logic. The more people were taught to see themselves as isolated individuals rather than members of a moral or spiritual community, the easier it became to dissolve solidarity and replace it with competition. A fragmented society is easier to rule.

The mechanistic outlook also provided a moral alibi for inequality. In an age dominated by deterministic thinking, social and economic hierarchies were no longer perceived as unjust but as the “natural” outcome of a rational, meritocratic order. If the universe is a machine governed by impersonal laws, then those who rise to the top must have done so by merit. Wealth is recast not as a responsibility but as a sign of personal worth. Poverty is reframed not as injustice but as personal failure. Thus the mechanistic worldview deepened alienation—from nature, from community, from the self—while legitimizing the domination of the many by the few.

The good news is that many are beginning to see through this illusion. The bad news is that the reaction is not always rational or constructive. Frustrated by declining living standards and political stagnation, people often turn to scapegoats—immigrants, minorities, or other vulnerable groups—instead of confronting the systemic forces that generate inequality. This dynamic reflects more than political dysfunction; it is the expression of a deeper spiritual vacuum. When people lack meaningful frameworks to make sense of their suffering, they become susceptible to narratives rooted in fear and blame rather than in justice and solidarity.

Politically, the first task is to restore the idea of public office as a form of service rather than an avenue for personal gain. We must cultivate a civic culture in which authority is recognized as a trust held for the good of the community. Today’s political class, too often celebrated for material success alone, is the product of a society that equates wealth with leadership. Our electorate must begin by asking which values—beyond material attainment—they want reflected in their representatives.

Secondly, we must limit the influence of money in politics. Without such reform, office will continue to attract those who seek private benefit rather than public good. This problem is most visible in the United States but increasingly shapes political life in Europe and large democracies like India. Studies consistently show that in these contexts, public opinion has only a marginal effect on actual policy outcomes. In the U.S., the problem was deepened by the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision, which ruled that restrictions on independent political expenditures by corporations and unions violated the First Amendment. This opened the floodgates for Super PACs and dark money groups to dominate elections and discourse. Because this interpretation is embedded in constitutional law, meaningful reform would likely require a constitutional amendment—a high bar that underscores the depth of the challenge.

Yet no constitutional amendment—or any meaningful reform—will emerge unless society is morally united and guided by a clear and compelling vision. This requires more than institutional change; it requires moral leadership: individuals and movements capable of galvanizing public will and articulating a shared purpose. Figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi exemplified this kind of leadership. They did not merely call for legal reforms; they appealed to the conscience of their societies, grounding their demands in ethical and spiritual frameworks that transcended narrow self-interest. For reform to take root today, we need institutions—religious, educational, civic—that can cultivate such leaders and sustain a moral discourse capable of binding communities together.
